My First game created with my classmates during Software Engineering Course. 
This project take about 2 months to be complete because programmers in the team have to learn how to create game from scratch.
We had our discussion about tools and roles, eventually we decided to use Unity and C# for our project. 
The game that we created is called "Sneak Sleep Game" which is casual and 2D pixel art game. I'm a programmer and UX/UI designer in this project.
